<!--This website, in lack of any other ideas, will be a dedicated informative page about my "Night Lords" miniature figure armylist for the tabletop game Warhammer.-->
<!--My aim is for the site to contain entries for each type of model/unit including visuals like images, their fictive backstory and rules for the actual game.-->
<!--Currently I want the page to have an internal navigation function and links to external material.-->
<!--In the (far) future the goal is to make the website fully interactive so anyone can add their own armies and create their own page directly through the website.-->
