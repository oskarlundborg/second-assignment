/*I have a general idea of what I want to do with the site's layout and style but I have not gotten around to that yet.*/

/*I will finish working on the basic layout and then create some basic styles in CSS to fill out the concept of what the site
 is going to look like.*/

/*In the (far) future the goal is to create my own design elements where CSS can't fill the purpose I need design wise using Clip Studio.*/

/*Examples of future additions are all the basic things like different backgrounds for different sections, fonts and other 
minor style adjustments, and to use borders and drop shadows to piece together everything in a coherent visual style for the entire page.*/

/*As the content is based on an already existing and well established franchise it's going to be hard to find copyright free images 
and other material to use so for the moment I will ignore copyright when it comes to that until I look into it. Not that I'm planning 
on going live with this website ever but still. However with already established themes it will be easy to create appropriate color palettes*/
